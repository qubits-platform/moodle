	"question": "<h4>Background Information</h4>There are different types of vehicles used for traveling depending upon the mode of travel- air, water or land. In this project, you will animate these means of transport. Your animation should explain each type of vehicle used in the project.<br><a href='https://vimeo.com/661786492/0e59e7ad8b' target='_blank'>https://vimeo.com/661786492/0e59e7ad8b</a><br><img src='https://learn.qubitsedu.com/images/DP_L2_CP1_Image2.png' width='25%' height='100%' /><br><br><h4>Project Objective</h4>Create an animation that describes the types of vehicles used for different modesof transportation.<br><br><h4>Requirements</h4>◼ There should be a minimum of 3 scenes in your animation.<br>◼ Each scene should represent a different mode of transportation: air, water,and land.<br>◼ Each scene should have a character with your face riding the vehicle. Youcan also add other characters as passengers.<br>◼ The character and vehicle should be moving when the animation begins.<br>◼ When the rider character is tapped, it should talk to the user describingthe type of vehicle it is riding.<br>◼ The project should be named Let Us Travel.<br><br>Computer science professionals break larger projects into smaller milestonesto focus on the end goal. In a similar fashion, here are some milestones for you.Achieve each milestone and submit the result to your teacher.<br><img src='https://learn.qubitsedu.com/images/DP_L2_CP1_Table1.png' width='60%' height='80%' />",

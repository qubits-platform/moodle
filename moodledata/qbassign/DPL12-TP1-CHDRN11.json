	"question": "Create a program that outputs a timeline of significant school events that have impacted your life. The timeline should be displayed vertically, with earlier events appearing near the top and later events near the bottom.<br><br>Output format:<br>Your program should produce an output that adheres to the following formatting rules:<br>●  The title 'School events timeline' should be displayed at the top.<br>●  The class should be displayed on the left side of the output.<br>●  A vertical line (|) should be displayed next to the class. It should run all the way down the output.<br>●  The class should be left-aligned, with at least one space between the class and the vertical line.<br>●  Four lines of space should separate each class.<br>●  To the right of the vertical line, display the month and year in which each event took place, for example, 4/01, separated by a space.<br>●  To the right of the date, briefly describe the event.<br>Timeline content:<br>Make a list of at least five significant school-related events that have impacted you.

The grade should increment in one-year periods, appearing after every four lines in the output.<br><br>Research how to use tabs (\t) in your print statements  to enhance the layout of your timeline.<br><br>Here is a sample output:<br><img src='https://learn.qubitsedu.com/images/DPL12U1S01Image3.png' width='40%' height='85%'>",

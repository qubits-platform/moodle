  "question": "As a librarian, you have a list of books available in the library. Write a pseudocode and JavaScript code that asks the user to enter a book title. If the book is in the list, the program should display a message indicating that it is available and remove it from the list, simulating a book checkout. If the book is not on the list, the program should display a message indicating that the book is not available. Then, it should allow the user to return a book, i.e., add a book title back to the list. Finally, it should display the updated list of books. ",

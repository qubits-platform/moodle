	"title" : "Capstone Project - AI Based Waste Segregation",
	"question": "<h4>Background Information</h4>A lot of waste is produced everyday at our homes, in schools, in offices, in factories and other places. This waste contains different types of materials. Some are biodegradable, some are not. Some can be recycled while some need to be dumped in a landfi ll after proper treatment.<br><br>Waste segregation is the process of sorting and separating different types of waste for disposal. It helps us to save the environment.<br><br>While human labor can sort 30 to 40 items per minute, AI-powered machines cansort 160 items in the same amount of time.<br><br>In this project you have to train the machine to recognize different types of waste such as plastic, metal, paper/cardboard and e-waste.<br><br><h4>Project Objective</h4>Develop an AI-based waste segregation system using the Teachable Machine.<br><br><img src='https://learn.qubitsedu.com/images/DP_L4_CP2_Image1.png' width='40%' height='70%' /><br><br><h4>Requirements</h4> Here are the milestones you need to achieve to finish this project<br><img src='https://learn.qubitsedu.com/images/DP_L4_CP2_Table1.png' width='50%' height='70%' /><br><br><h4>Additional challenges</h4>Train the machine to recognize recyclable and non-recyclable materials.",

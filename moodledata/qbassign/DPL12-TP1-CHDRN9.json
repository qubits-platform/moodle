	"question": "The following paragraph by an author needs formatting:<br><br>What is GPS? GPS,or Global Positioning System, is a radio navigation system that uses satellites to work. It helps to determine the position of an object on Earth using radio frequencies. GPS mainly comprises a space segment having satellites, a control segment having ground antennas and control stations, and a user segment consisting of receivers. A network of low-earth orbit satellites work together in this system, also called a constellation, to provide positioning, navigation, and timing services. The radars available at the ground control station ensure their accuracy, and the GPS receivers catch any signal that may emanate from them.<br><br>This challenge requires you to fix the organization of this essay. Each new sentence should start from a new line.<br><br>The final output should look like this:<br><img src='https://learn.qubitsedu.com/images/DPL12U1S01Image1.png' width='55%' height='85%'>",

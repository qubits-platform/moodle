	"question": "<h4>Background Information</h4>Have you ever waved goodbye to your friend or nodded your head to say yes to a chocolate chip cookie on offer?Movements of the body parts such as hands, arms, head or face to convey a message are called gestures. They are a non verbal way of communication.This project requires you to train a machine using Teachable Machine and develop an application in Scratch that would recognize different gestures like thumbs up and thumbs down.<br><br><h4>Project Objective</h4>Develop a gesture recognition program using Teachable Machine and Scratch.<br><br><h4>Requirements</h4><img src='https://learn.qubitsedu.com/images/DP_L5_CP2_Table1.png' width='40%' height='60%' />Here are the milestones you need to achieve to finish this project.<br><br><h4>Additional challenges</h4>Research and find out some of the common gestures used by humans. Train the machine to recognize at least two of those gestures. Program the sprite in Scratch to recognize and say these gestures when displayed by the user.",

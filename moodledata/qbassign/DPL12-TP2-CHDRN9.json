	"question": "Write a program that helps the users manage their fitness goals.<br>1. Ask for two integers: the first is the goal value and the second is the actual value. Thegoal could be anything, such as walking 10,000 steps a day, eating five differentvegetables a day, spending 30 minutes on exercise, practicing a favorite activity for 20 minutes, and so on. The actual value refers to the real or achieved outcome of the goal.<br>2. Create three boolean variables, as described below, to help the users determine whether they met their goal.<br>a. The first boolean should be true if the users exceed their goal.<br> b. The second boolean should be true if the users are not able to reach the goal.<br>c. The third boolean should be true if the users meet the goal exactly.<br>3. Print the results (that is, the value of the booleans).<br>Here is an example:<br><img src='https://learn.qubitsedu.com/images/DPL12U02S01Image1.png' width='50%' height='70%'>",

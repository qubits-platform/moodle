When the program begins, with the click on the<img src='https://learn.qubitsedu.com/theme/qubitsbasic/pix/scratch-go.svg' width='3%' height='3%'>, both the dancers should appear on the stage. You have to program them to show a variety of dance moves at different events.The project is divided into smaller stages or milestones. You will be assessed as you achieve one after the other to complete the entire task<br><br><h4>Project Objective</h4>Design and develop an animation based on the given theme using Scratch.<br><br><h4>Requirements</h4>This game must include the following items:<br>1.

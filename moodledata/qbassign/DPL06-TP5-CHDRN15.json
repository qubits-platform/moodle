	"title" : "Capstone Project - Stop Global Warming",
	"question": "<h4>Background information</h4>Design and code a game that creates awareness about global warming.<br><br><h4>Project objective</h4>Your game should have different types of sprites appearing on the Stage. There should be sprites that help control global warming and those that cause global warming. For instance, some of the sprites that prevent global warming can be trees, saplings, renewable energy sources like the Sun and wind mill, electric cars and bikes, and bicycles. Sprites that cause global warming can be deforestation,fossil fuels, automobiles that run on petrol, factories, forest fires and so on.The sprites should appear randomly on the Stage area, repeatedly. The player should click on the sprites that help prevent global warming to get positive points.If the player clicks on the sprites that cause global warming then a negative point should be added to the score.<br><br><h4>Requirements</h4>Here are the milestones you need to achieve to finish this project.<br><img src='https://learn.qubitsedu.com/images/DP_L6_CP3_Table1_new.png' width='50%' height='50%' /><br><br><h4>Additional Challenge</h4>Try to add a reset button, that will restart the game",

	"question": "Write a Java program for a character in an online adventure game that helps it decide whether to open a certain door or not. Use logical operators and short-circuit evaluation.<br>The program should perform the following tasks:<br>1. Prompt the user: 'Do you have the key? (true/false)'<br>2. Accept the user's response as a boolean value. Note that the user can only enter true or false.<br>3. Prompt the user: 'Are you strong enough? (true/false)'<br>4. Accept the user's response as a boolean value. Note that the user can only enter true or false.<br>5. Declare a boolean variable named isOpenDoor and set it to false.<br>6. Use short-circuit evaluation to check if the character has both the key and enough strength to open the door. If both the conditions are met, set isOpenDoor to true.<br>7. Display the character's decision based on whether the door is open or not.",

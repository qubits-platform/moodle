	"question": "Develop a Java program that generates a square root quiz for users. The program should start by asking the user how many questions they would like to attempt. Using a loop, generate the specified number of questions, each of which presents a random number ranging from 0 to 20 (both inclusive). Prompt the user to calculate the square root of the displayed number and enter their answer. Evaluate the user's answer allowing for a small tolerance (for example, 0.01) and print an appropriate message indicating whether the answer is correct or incorrect. Utilize the Math.sqrt() function from the Java Math class to perform the calculations for comparison.<br>Sample Output:<br><img src='https://learn.qubitsedu.com/images/DP_L12_U05_S03_Challenge3.jpg' height='50%' width='50%'>",

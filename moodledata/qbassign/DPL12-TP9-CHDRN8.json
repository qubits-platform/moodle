	"question": "Create a sophisticated Vehicle Management System that orchestrates various types of vehicles, such as cars, bicycles, and motorbikes. The challenge involves multiple levels of inheritance and careful consideration of attributes and constructors.<br>● Vehicle Class:Thesuperclass,Vehicle,should include common attributes such as make, model, color, and weight.<br>● CarsClass:A sub class of Vehicle ,Cars must add specific attributes like engine type (diesel, petrol, and electric), number of doors, and seating capacity.<br>● Bicycles Class:Extending Vehicle,Bicycles should include attributes like gear count and frame material.<br>● MotorbikesClass:AnothersubclassofVehicle,Motorbikesshouldincorporate attributes like engine capacity and bike type (cruiser, sport, and touring).<br>Design the class hierarchy to define common attributes and behaviors in the Vehicle class while specialized attributes are defined in the respective subclasses.",

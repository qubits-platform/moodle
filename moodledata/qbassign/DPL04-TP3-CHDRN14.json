	"question": "You might have heard about the food chain. Do you know that there are big ﬁsh in an aquatic food chain that feed on small ﬁsh, which in turn feed on smaller insects and plants? Create a game based on the food chain.<br><br>Here is an example of how you can do this. A big ﬁsh is controlled with the keyboard keys to move forward and backward. A small ﬁsh appears randomly on the stage. You have to try to catch the small ﬁsh with the big ﬁsh. Every time a small ﬁsh is caught, you will score a point. You can create this game or design a new game based on a similar concept.<br><img src='https://learn.qubitsedu.com/images/DP_L04_U03_S04_GroupChallenge2.jpg' width='40%' height='70%' /><br>Discuss in groups and write down your game plan below.",
